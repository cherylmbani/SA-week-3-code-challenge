Description

This is a minimal blog application that allows users to:

- View a list of blog post titles
- Click on a post to see its full content
- Add a new blog post using a form
- Display the first post automatically when the page loads

This was built as a learning project for understanding how to fetch and render data from a local API (`json-server`) and dynamically update the DOM based on user actions.
