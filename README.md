## Description

This is a basic blog application that allows users to:

- View a list of blog post titles  
- Click a post to see its full details (title, content, author, image)  
- Add a new blog post via a form  
- Automatically show the first post on page load  

The project uses `json-server` to simulate a backend API and is designed for learning and practicing JavaScript skills.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create or clone the project folder**

   If you already have your folder, skip to step 2. Otherwise:

   ```bash
   git clone your-repo-url
   cd your-folder-name
   ```

2. **Inside the folder, ensure you have the following files:**

   - `index.html`  
   - `src/index.js`  
   - `css/styles.css`  
   - `db.json` with sample blog post data  

3. **Install JSON Server globally (only once):**

   ```bash
   npm install -g json-server
   ```

4. **Start the JSON Server using:**

   ```bash
   json-server db.json
   ```

   This will run your mock backend at:  
   `http://localhost:3000/posts`

5. **Open your `index.html` in the browser**  
   You can double-click it or use a tool like Live Server to preview it live.
